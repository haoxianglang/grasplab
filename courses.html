									<p>This course provides students with the tools required to design, model, analyse and control mechatronic systems; i.e.
									smart systems comprising electronic, mechanical, fluid and thermal components. The techniques for modelling various
									system components will be studied in a unified approach developing tools for the simulation of the performance of these
									systems. Analysis will also be made of the various components needed to design and control mechatronic systems including
									sensing, actuating, and I/O interfacing components.</p>

									<br/>
									<p>This course builds upon the knowledge students have gained in a first control course to cover more materials in advanced
									control systems. Topics covered will include: a. State variables and state space models: Relations between state space
									models and the transfer-function models (controllable and observable canonical forms, and diagonal form), Jordan form,
									solutions of linear state equations, transition matrix. b. Controllability and observability: Definition and criteria,
									state feedback and output feedback, pole assignment via state feedback, design of servo-controlled systems. c. State
									estimation and observer: Observer state-variable feedback control. d. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems: Pole
									assignment via state feedback. Introduction to Linear quadratic regulator (LQR), intelligent control and model
									predictive control.
