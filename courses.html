									<br/>
									<p>This course builds upon the knowledge students have gained in a first control course to cover more materials in advanced
									control systems. Topics covered will include: a. State variables and state space models: Relations between state space
									models and the transfer-function models (controllable and observable canonical forms, and diagonal form), Jordan form,
									solutions of linear state equations, transition matrix. b. Controllability and observability: Definition and criteria,
									state feedback and output feedback, pole assignment via state feedback, design of servo-controlled systems. c. State
									estimation and observer: Observer state-variable feedback control. d. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems: Pole
									assignment via state feedback. Introduction to Linear quadratic regulator (LQR), intelligent control and model
									predictive control.
